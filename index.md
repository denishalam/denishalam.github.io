### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was one of my favorite labs because, despite being longer than some of the others, it was one of the most enjoyable for me. It gave me the opportunity to create functions for the first time that generated moving colored images in ImageMagick. Although it felt a bit intimidating at first, working through the lab taught me that repetition in coding can actually be beneficial and efficient.

* Lab 8

    I really enjoyed Lab 8 because in Part 1 it combined math in a real world setting with coding, giving me insight into how calculations can be turned into functions within a program. I had always wondered how math and coding could be integrated and whether it would be challenging or tedious. However, after completing the lab, I found it manageable and surprisingly enjoyable.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 ended up being one of my favorite labs because it gave me the chance to create functions that combined mathematical math with coding. In Part 1, we focused on more practical, calculation-based math, such as using equations to find the area of a rectangle. This lab taught me how to integrate real-world math concepts into coding, and while it was challenging toward the end, I found the experience both rewarding and enjoyable.
